This addon defines a Foundry Virtual Tabletop module that adds a new setting to the game world called "Item to give to players". This setting allows the game master to specify the name of the item that players will receive when the /give chat command is used.

The addon also adds the /give chat command, which sends a message to the server using a socket connection. The server-side addon receives this message and gives all players an item with the name specified in the "Item to give to players" setting.

To use this addon, you will need to create a new module in Foundry Virtual Tabletop and paste the addon into the JavaScript file for the module. You can then enable the module in your game world and use the /give chat command to give all players the specified item.
